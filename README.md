### To have this project running locally:

1 - Clone the project using `git clone`

2 - Create an account on the OpenAi platform

3 - Copy the OpenAi API key to the `application.properties` file

4 - On the Controller, check the Client URL on the @CrossOrigin annotation

5 - Run the application

6 - Test the application via curl (or an HTTP client of your choice) - I developed an UI project you can use for this API that can be found [here](https://github.com/RaquelMichelon/study-plan-vuejs-ui)

## üíª Project

This is an API that lists the 5 most important content to be studyed given a subject.

> Note! For the sake of simplicity and because it is beyond this mini-project scope, all classes were written in the same file, which is not recommended for real projects.
